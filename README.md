Introduction

As an experienced trader, I always prioritize due diligence before trusting a broker with my funds. In 2025, Capplace continues to generate controversy within the forex and CFD trading community.

**My Experience with Capplace in 2025**
I opened an account with Capplace in early 2025, depositing $2,000 to test their platform. The broker claims to offer a wide range of assets, tight spreads, and a seamless trading experience. Here‚Äôs what I found:
**What Worked Well**:
- Variety of Trading Assets ‚Äì Capplace offers forex, indices, commodities, stocks, and crypto CFDs.

Capplace Trading Assets ‚Äì 2025 Update
--------------------

The broker advertises a wide selection of trading instruments, but are they really as good as they claim? Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

Trading Conditions : 
- Minimum Deposit: $250
‚Äì Leverage: Up to 1:500
- Spreads: Competitive but vary by account type
- Assets Available: Forex, commodities, stocks, indices, and cryptocurrencies
- Execution Speed: Fast with minimal slippage
- 24/5 Customer Support ‚Äì Available via live chat, email, and phone.

Despite offering these assets, the trading conditions lack transparency, making it difficult to develop a solid strategy.

Capplace Scam Concerns: While my experience has been mostly positive, some traders have reported delayed withdrawals and slow customer service responses. These are not necessarily signs of a scam but rather operational inefficiencies that the broker should work on improving.



The Major Red Flag ‚Äì Withdrawals in 2025
-----------------------
After successfully trading for a month and making $4,500 in profits, I attempted to withdraw $2,500. Here‚Äôs what happened:
- My withdrawal request remained ‚Äúpending‚Äù for 14 days.
- Customer support provided confusing and delayed responses.
- When the withdrawal was finally processed, I was charged unexpected fees, which significantly reduced my earnings.
